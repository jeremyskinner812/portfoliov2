        I am a full stack developer with a background in management and sales. I have a passion for learning and problem solving, am a quick learner, and always looking for new challenges and opportunities. I recently earned a certificate in full stack development from the University of California, Irvine. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and MongoDB. I am also familiar with MySQL, Sequelize, and GraphQL. I am currently looking for a full time position as a web or software developer.

        In my free time I enjoy running, kayaking, and spending time with my friends and family. I also enjoy working on personal projects and learning new technologies and skills. I am currently taking a self paced course on Python from the University of California, Irvine.
